# tools

Repository contains:
* Suckless utilities (and their configurations)
* init.vim for NeoVim
* .zshrc for zsh

* ANGRYsearch and .conf file
* A script to reset particular USB devices
* XMousePasteBlock to stop middle click paste behavior
* fzf to fuzzily search
* input-remapper to reconfigure device mappings
* a script for the office monitor setup (and likely useless elsewhere)


List of things for Linux configuration:

    * Get and configure NeoVim from the init.vim here
    * Get XMousePasteBlock from https://github.com/milaq/XMousePasteBlock
      Download to directory, install dependencies as detailed in the README, 
      then <make clean install>, then add to startup scripts.
    * Get ANGRYsearch
    * Install newest version of TexLive
        - bring in .latexmkrc from this repo
    * get zsh and kitty (.conf here) or luke smith's st (here)
    * Install oh-my-zsh

    * install logo-ls and a patched nerd font, then run
    the fix described here to get the logo-ls icons to show
    up correctly in the terminal:
      ``https://github.com/Yash-Handa/logo-ls/issues/49``
      If for some reason the fix goes down just scrap the 
      whole thing---it's not worth it.
